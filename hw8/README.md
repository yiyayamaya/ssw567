### part 1
- What are you going to test, e.g. which website?  
 reddit
- Describe your experimental method, e.g. what approach did you use?  What questions did you ask?  
 one Direct Task and one Scenario Task with Concurrent Probing

- Describe the number of subjects  
one young man, my roommate

- Describe the quantitative data you collected during the testing  
Success rates 100%  
task1: posting something: 2 mins  
task2: config sorting threads by time by default rather than popularity: 14 mins  

- Describe the results of the System Usability Scale

| Q# | Question                                                                                  | Response | Score     |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| 1  | I think I would like to use this system frequently                                        | 3        | 2         |
| 2  | I found the system unnecessarily complex                                                  | 2        | 3         |
| 3  | I thought the system was easy to use                                                      | 4        | 3         |
| 4  | I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system | 2        | 3         |
| 5  |                   I found the various functions in the system were well integrated                                                                        | 4        | 3         |
| 6  |              I thought there was too much inconsistency in the this system                                                                             | 2        | 3         |
| 7  |           I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly                                                                                | 4        | 3         |
| 8  |           I found the system very cumbersome to use                                                                                | 2        | 3         |
| 9  |             I felt very confident using the system                                                                              | 4        | 3         |
| 10 |        I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system                                                                                   | 2        | 3         |
|    |                                                                                           |          | 2.5*30=75 |




- Describe the qualitative data including your observations from the experiments.  
in task 2, the subject had to google and found some passage to config it. that's what exactly I experienced when I was new to reddit
despite this, the subject gave very positive feedback in the System Usability Scale. I think that's because he does not consider task 2 a very common need

### part 2:
I chose Accessibility color wheel by Giacomo Mazzocato.

this tool tries to help in this task by analyzing the contrast between a pair of colors and showing how color-blind people will see it. For example, Protanopia is insensitivity to red, this tool can simulate the vision of protanope (partially color blind) people.  

with it we can analyze whether the colors are good in case of normal vision and for every specific kind of color blindness.
